#Reddit Recommendation Engine

**Implementation of a Recommendation Engine for Reddit**

**You can check how I built this app in http://blog.manugarri.com/building-a-recommendation-engine-for-reddit-part-1/()**

###HOWTO

1. Check the `seed` folder to see how to set up your dataset.

2. Run the web application. You can use the `reddit_recommender_python` for a python implementation or the `reddit_recommender_go` for the Go implementation.
